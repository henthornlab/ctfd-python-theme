Some ideas to beautify the themes using Python

Let's make sure that CTFd looks great!

We could use Rose Red 128,0,0 as a theme color

Gonna ask people for their ideas on accent colors that work well with Rose Red.

Somebody answered about using the gray color seen everywhere on campus. Not feeling it.

Oops.
